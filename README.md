Mapitko is a simple web app that helps you locate distant objects on a map using basic triangulation. You can input different positions and their azimuth angles to find the location of the object.

## How to Use

1. Go to [Mapitko App](https://mapitko.github.io/mapitko.html).
2. Click on the "Add Position" button to enter the latitude, longitude, and azimuth angle for each position from where you want to locate the object.
3. The app will calculate and display the location of the object on the map based on the entered positions and azimuth angles.

## Features

- Add multiple positions along with their respective azimuth angles.
- Triangulate the location of the object on the map using the entered positions.
- Saves Points do browser local storage
- Points import/export

## Development

Mapitko is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app uses basic trigonometry to perform triangulation calculations.
